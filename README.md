# Movies-ETL analyst

## Overview of Project:

Extract, transform, load logic applied to: 1) extract data from Wikipedia and Kaggle; 2) transform (or cleanse) extract data; 3) load of transformed and merged data into PostgreSQL database tables.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

No challenges were encountered during the analysis. But assumptions or additional actions taken include:

* file directory/structure utilized within Jupyter notebooks aligned to execution folder structure/design.  Github repository folder structure created to align with Challenge expectations for files to be places into a 'Resources' folder.  This folder structure/file directory difference presents itself within the Python, Pandas, and ETL process logic and file references but file directory references will require update for re-execution.
